# Medicare State Comparison Analysis

In this project, I compare 2013 Medicare payment data between Massachusetts and Tennessee. To conduct this analysis, I use the public Medicare physician 2013 payment data found on the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website (here: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Physician-and-Other-Supplier2013.html). 

I also use 2013 population estimate data from the US Census Bureau (included in this repo, 'PEP_2013_PEPSYASEX_with_ann.csv').

This project is coded entirely in R. For a complete description and analysis, please see the project report included in this repository ('medicare_comparison_project_report.pdf').
